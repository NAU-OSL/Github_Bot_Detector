# Bot_Detector
Currently:
A project that will grab information from a MongoDB database (which has been mined from Github repositories), sort the data based by author, and analyze the comments against each other to determine a percentage of certainty on whether or not the author of those comments is a bot. 

Future:
This project will expand to include an analysis of an author's profile on Github to create a more accurate reading of whether or not a user is a bot.

<i> Please note, this code is designed to run on a Linux machine and includes packages that will not work on Windows </i>
